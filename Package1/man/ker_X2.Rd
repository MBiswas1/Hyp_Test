\title{This function provides the quadratic kernel corresponding to X and E}
\usage{
ker_X2(X, E)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{is a matrix. Each column of X corresponds to q many covariates of an individual}

\item{E}{is the matrix corresponding to the component of the kernel that does not involve X.}
}
\value{
K is the kernel matrix that would have been if data were observed at all the available time points.
}
\description{
This function provides the quadratic kernel corresponding to X and E
}
\details{
The kronecker product of the kernel for X and the kernel that does not depend on X.
